	<p>The massive stone structure was built by up to 20,000 workers between 1805 and 1820 as part of a system of fortifications designed to keep the newly independent nation of Haiti safe from French incursions. The Citadel was built several miles inland, and atop the 3,000 ft (910 m) Bonnet a L’Eveque mountain, to deter attacks and to provide a lookout into the nearby valleys. Cap-Haïtien and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are visible from the roof of the fortress. Anecdotally, it is possible to sight the eastern coast of Cuba, some 90 miles (140 km) to the west, on clear days.</p>

	<ul>
    <li>The Haitians outfitted the fortress with 365 cannons of varying size. 
	These were obtained from various nations, and still bear the crests of 18th Century monarchs.</li>

 	<li>Enormous stockpiles of cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls.</li>

	<li>Since its construction, the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes, though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Citadel was part of a system of fortifications that included Fort Jacques and Fort Alexandre, built on the mountains overlooking Port-au-Prince. Dessalines ordered those forts built in 1805 to protect the new nation against French attacks.</p>
